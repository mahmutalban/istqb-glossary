# istqb-glossary

#ISTQB Glossary app is a dictionary that I am builded with React Native. My intention is to help to anyone whom searching certain terminology instead of sitting and spending hours on internet. 

The app will be supporting;
- Multiple languages
- Real time searching
- App will fetch data from an API or local JSON file (not decided yet)
- There will not be any register or login for users (maybe in future)
